A tool to switch between Fn keys modes for Apple keyboards

Apple keyboards are something special in both bad and good senses of this word. This script tries to help circumventing one of their major flaws -- the absence of Fn key switch, and enables user to change the mode of Fn keys "on the fly". Basically it is enough to run this tool without any argument and you're done. For those who don't like the default settings, feel free to modify driver parameters in switch_mode function.

This script is heavily based on Canonical's `prime-switch` tool which is a good start for initiatives like this one.
Thanks, @canonical!
